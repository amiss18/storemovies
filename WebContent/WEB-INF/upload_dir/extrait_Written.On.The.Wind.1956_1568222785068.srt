00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:57,438
Hello.

2
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:01,945
- What happened to Mrs. Black?
- My predecessor? She was paroled.

3
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,418
So you're the new
executive secretary, huh?

4
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:08,218
Don't let that title deceive you.
I do everything but wipe windshields.

5
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,793
- I'm Mitch Wayne.
- Yes, I recognized you.

6
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:14,261
- I'm Lucy Moore.
- Recognized me? From where?

7
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16,594
Oh, come now. Surely you realize...

8
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,294
how often your photograph
has graced our tabloids?

9
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,318
But the captions
usually read, "Kyle Hadley,

10
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,228
Prince Charming of the oil empire,
and friend."

11
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,237
The dashing Kyle Hadley.

12
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,539
I saw him dash
through the office recently.

13
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,807
Seems he misplaced his money belt.

14
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:36,579
- Again?
- A hat was passed, and I contributed $16.47.

15
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:40,213
Well, for that, you ought to get
an oil well named after you.
